Personal Portfolio Website~media/images/placeholder.png~Portfolio Website! (this one)~I wanted to create a versatile and mutli-purpose portfolio to showcase my skills and abilities to use for Internship. I added many different features that showcase my coding skills, such as multilanguage support, and a dark/light mode switch. The design is a very simple but classy and edgy design, which utilises a very trendy style commonly seen in UI today.~HTML/CSS~UI/UX
CADC x Comm Workshop~media/images/PubsSpeaking.jpg~Public Speaking Workshop~As a collaboration with the Communicators, I was given the opportunity to host and organize a workshop, by myself, on public speaking to my peers. Through this experience, I was pushed out of my comfort zone and learned a lot about how to run workshops, teach, and be engaging. Not only did I manage to pass all my public speaking knowledge and experience gained through presentations and debating, but I also got to meet tons of new people and had a lot of fun :)~Communication~Public Speaking
